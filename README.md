# Weirdo Estimates Intrustion & Really Dangerous Objects

Weirdo is a project to detect anomalies in the Los Alamos National Lab cyber security event data.  The data is hosted on their website:
 csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1   

The team developing this project is assuming that red team injections into the event data can be considered different than a normal user and 
can therefore be considered anomalous.  

The project is written in python.
